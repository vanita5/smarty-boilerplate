# Smarty Boilerplate

This used to be my boilerplate for small PHP Smarty projects at work.

It comes with my own logging implementation and some interfaces I used
quite often in the past.

## Tools

Here are some of the tools it is intended to use with:

#### [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
Dependencies:
* Smarty
* PHPunit

#### [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/) 
as the template engine

#### [PHPunit](https://phpunit.de/) 
for unit tests

#### [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) 
which is a CSS authoring framework using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)

#### CWLog
self-written logging library

#### pdo.lib.php
is a wrapper for PDO which provides the same API as our old company internal *sql.lib.php* wrapper for PEAR's *DB.php*.

#### [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
